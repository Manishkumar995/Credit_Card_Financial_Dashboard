🧮 SQL Query Samples
1. Total Monthly Transaction Amount
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') AS Month,
    SUM(transaction_amount) AS Total_Amount
FROM credit_card_data
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;

2. Customer-Level Summary
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(transaction_amount) AS Total_Spend,
    SUM(late_fee) AS Total_Late_Fee,
    AVG(credit_utilization) AS Avg_Utilization
FROM credit_card_data
GROUP BY customer_id;

3. Identify High-Risk Customers
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS Late_Payments
FROM credit_card_data
WHERE payment_status = 'Late'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING Late_Payments > 3;

🧠 Key DAX Measures (Power BI)
1. Total Revenue
Total Revenue = SUM(Transactions[Revenue])

2. Average Transaction Value
Avg Transaction = AVERAGE(Transactions[Transaction_Amount])

3. On-Time Payment %
On Time % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Transactions), Transactions[Payment_Status] = "On-Time"),
    COUNTROWS(Transactions)
)

4. Credit Utilization %
Utilization % = AVERAGE(Transactions[Credit_Utilization])
